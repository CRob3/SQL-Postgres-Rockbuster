# SQL-Postgres-Rockbuster
## Rockbuster is a hypothetical company which was used to learn SQL coding in PostgreSQL.  The company rents movies and wants to know: 
### Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
### What was the average rental duration for all videos?
### Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
### Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
### Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
## To answer these questions basic queries, filters, cleaning and summarizing data, joins, subqueries, and common table expressions were done.  Finally a Tableau presentation was created to show the results that answered the company questions.
